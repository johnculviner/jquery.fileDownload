jQuery File Download is a cross server platform compatible jQuery plugin that allows for an Ajax-like file download experience that isn't normally possible using the web.

### Requirements
* jQuery 1.6+

### Supported and tested browsers
* Internet Explorer 6+ - Works fine for standard use cases except in < IE9 JavaScript access to the *failed* response HTML doesn't (and can't) work reliably due to browser iframe constraints.
* Firefox 11+ - reasonably sure it will work on earlier versions
* Chrome 17+ - reasonably sure it will work on earlier versions
* iOS 5.0+ - reasonably sure it will work on earlier versions 
* Android 4.0+ - non-GET requests do not work due to a long-standing [bug](http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=1780) in the Android browser. This is handled 'gracefully' with a message to the user.
